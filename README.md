# Pharo
This repository is dedicated to all things Pharoâ€”a dynamic, open-source, and reflective Smalltalk-inspired programming environment.

Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).
